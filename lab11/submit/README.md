# Spelling Bee

This project is a clone of the New York Times' Spelling Bee game

## Important:

- If using XQuartz, run this program locally (not SSH-ed on a student machine) for the best results. The program still functions correctly, but the shapes take longer to display to the screen running on the student machine using XQuartz.
- Make sure all word files (1-5.word) are located in the word_files directory; otherwise this program will exit with errors upon trying to load them.
