1. Is it assumed that any word entered will be 15 letters or less? If it is longer, do we need to alert the user?

2. If a one letter word is entered, do we need to alert the user or just ignore it?

3. When doing file input and output, should the list of entered words be printed to the terminal (or output file)?
